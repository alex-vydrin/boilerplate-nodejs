# Code Conventions

When writing or modifying code in this project, please adhere to the following conventions:

1.  **TypeScript Best Practices**: Follow standard, idiomatic TypeScript coding practices for structure, naming, and types, unless otherwise overridden.
2.  **Minimal Comments**: Avoid adding comments unless they explain complex logic or non-obvious decisions. Well-written, self-explanatory code is preferred. Do not add comments that merely restate what the code does.
3.  **File naming conventions**: Use kebab-case when naming directories, TypeScript, and other files.
